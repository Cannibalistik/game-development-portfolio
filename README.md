## Current Focus

I'm expanding into casino game development, particularly interested in exploring underserved markets like medieval-themed casino games.
My proven track record in player engagement mechanics, retention systems, and understanding of player psychology translates directly to casino gaming environments.

My experience with:
- **Million+ user content creation**
- **Long-term player retention** (7+ years of continuous engagement)
- **Economic system design** (virtual currencies, trading, progression)
- **Risk/reward mechanics** (potion systems, crafting failures)

Makes me uniquely positioned to create engaging casino experiences that maintain long-term player interest.

Additionally, I'm developing extensions for the live streaming platform Kick in hopes they expand beyond their current webhook-based system to more comprehensive extension formats.
